# Feature-First Architecture

This directory contains feature-specific modules organized by business functionality rather than technical layers.

## Structure

Each feature follows the Clean Architecture pattern within its own directory:

```
features/
├── authentication/          # Login, registration, password reset
│   ├── presentation/       # UI components, pages, BLoCs
│   ├── domain/            # Feature-specific use cases, entities
│   └── data/              # Feature-specific repositories, data sources
├── home/                   # Home page and related functionality
│   ├── presentation/
│   ├── domain/
│   └── data/
├── product/               # Product listing, search, details
│   ├── presentation/
│   ├── domain/
│   └── data/
└── profile/              # User profile management
    ├── presentation/
    ├── domain/
    └── data/
```

## Benefits

1. **Feature Isolation**: Each feature is self-contained with its own business logic
2. **Team Scalability**: Different teams can work on different features independently
3. **Code Organization**: Easier to find and maintain feature-specific code
4. **Testing**: Feature-specific tests are co-located with the feature code
5. **Reusability**: Features can be extracted as separate packages if needed

## Guidelines

- Keep shared utilities in the `/shared` module
- Keep app-wide resources in the `/resources` module
- Use dependency injection to connect features
- Maintain clean boundaries between features
