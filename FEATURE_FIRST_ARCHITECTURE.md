# Flutter Clean Architecture - Feature-First Approach

## Overview

This project has been updated to use a **Feature-First Clean Architecture** approach, which organizes code by business features rather than technical layers. This approach provides better scalability, maintainability, and team collaboration.

## Architecture Structure

### Feature-First Organization

```
app/lib/
├── features/                    # Feature-based modules
│   ├── authentication/         # Login, registration, password reset
│   │   ├── presentation/       # UI components, pages, BLoCs
│   │   │   ├── login_page.dart
│   │   │   └── bloc/
│   │   ├── domain/             # Feature-specific use cases, entities
│   │   └── data/               # Feature-specific repositories, data sources
│   ├── home/                   # Home page and related functionality
│   │   ├── presentation/
│   │   ├── domain/
│   │   └── data/
│   ├── product/               # Product listing, search, details
│   │   ├── presentation/
│   │   ├── domain/
│   │   └── data/
│   └── profile/              # User profile management
│       ├── presentation/
│       ├── domain/
│       └── data/
├── shared/                     # Cross-cutting concerns
├── config/                     # App configuration
├── di/                        # Dependency injection
├── navigation/                # App routing
└── resources/                 # App-wide resources
```

### Core Modules (Root Level)

- **domain/**: Shared business logic and entities
- **data/**: Shared data layer and infrastructure
- **shared/**: Common utilities and helpers
- **resources/**: App-wide resources (strings, themes, assets)

## Benefits of Feature-First Architecture

1. **Feature Isolation**: Each feature is self-contained with clear boundaries
2. **Team Scalability**: Multiple teams can work on different features simultaneously
3. **Code Organization**: Easier to locate and maintain feature-specific code
4. **Testing**: Feature tests are co-located with feature code
5. **Reusability**: Features can be extracted as separate packages
6. **Onboarding**: New developers can focus on specific features

## Migration from Layer-First

The project was migrated from a layer-first approach:

### Before (Layer-First)
```
lib/
├── ui/
│   ├── home/
│   ├── login/
│   ├── search/
│   └── ...
├── domain/
└── data/
```

### After (Feature-First)
```
lib/
├── features/
│   ├── authentication/
│   │   ├── presentation/
│   │   ├── domain/
│   │   └── data/
│   └── ...
└── shared modules...
```

## Development Guidelines

### Feature Development
1. Create a new feature directory under `features/`
2. Implement presentation layer (UI, BLoCs)
3. Add feature-specific domain logic if needed
4. Implement feature-specific data layer if needed
5. Export public APIs through feature barrel file

### Shared Code
- Use `shared/` for utilities used across multiple features
- Use `resources/` for app-wide resources
- Keep core domain entities in the root `domain/` module

### Dependencies
- Features should depend on shared modules, not on each other
- Use dependency injection to connect features
- Maintain clean boundaries between features

## Package Updates

The project has also been updated with latest package versions:

- Flutter SDK: 3.24.4+
- Dart SDK: 3.5.4+
- Melos: 6.2.0+
- flutter_bloc: 9.1.0+
- auto_route: 7.8.4+
- get_it: 8.0.2+

## Building and Running

The existing build commands and scripts remain unchanged:

```bash
# Bootstrap dependencies
melos bootstrap

# Build all modules
melos run build_all

# Run tests
melos run test

# Format code
melos run format

# Run analysis
melos run analyze
```

## Future Considerations

1. **Feature Extraction**: Individual features can be extracted into separate packages
2. **Micro-frontends**: Features can be developed and deployed independently
3. **Feature Flags**: Implement feature toggles for gradual rollouts
4. **API Boundaries**: Define clear contracts between features
